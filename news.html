            <h3>Islam A. Sayed selected among Top 20 Reviewers at IEEE ECCE 2025</h3>
            <p class="news-date">October 2025</p>
            <p>
                Congratulations to Islam A. Sayed for being recognized among the Top 20 Reviewers in 
                the Power Converters & Control Track at IEEE ECCE 2025 — one of the flagship conferences 
                in power electronics. This recognition reflects outstanding technical contributions to the 
                review process and professional service to the IEEE community.
