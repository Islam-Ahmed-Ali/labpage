            <p>
                Dr. Yousef A. Mahmoud (Senior Member, IEEE) is an Associate Professor at Kennesaw State University.
                He received his Ph.D. from the University of Waterloo in 2016, specializing in photovoltaic systems,
                power electronics, protection, and real-time modeling.
            </p>

            <p>
                He serves as Associate Editor for the <em>IEEE Transactions on Energy Conversion</em> and
                <em>IEEE Power Engineering Letters</em>. His research includes solar diagnostics, fault detection,
                modeling of partially shaded PV systems, and highly efficient real-time PV estimators that enabled
                new computational-vision-based PV diagnostics.
