    <h2>About the iENERGY Lab</h2>
    <p>
        The <span class="gold">iENERGY Lab – Intelligent Energy Systems & Electrified Mobility Laboratory</span> 
        at Kennesaw State University conducts advanced research in <strong>state estimation for batteries and supercapacitors</strong>,
        <strong>energy management systems for electric vehicles</strong>, <strong>hybrid energy storage systems</strong>,
        <strong>renewable energy integration</strong>—particularly <strong>solar photovoltaic (PV) systems</strong>,
        <strong>wireless power transfer</strong>, and <strong>machine learning– and deep learning–based control of power electronic systems</strong>.
    </p>

    <p>
        Our work integrates physics-based modeling, machine learning, real-time embedded control,
        experimental validation, and system-level optimization to develop reliable, efficient,
        and intelligent electrified mobility and renewable energy technologies.
