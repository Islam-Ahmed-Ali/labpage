    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>
        The iENERGY Lab at Kennesaw State University is dedicated to advancing the future of 
        intelligent and sustainable energy systems. We focus on the intersection of 
        artificial intelligence, power electronics, real-time control, and hybrid energy 
        storage technologies for next-generation electric vehicles and renewable energy systems.
    </p>
    <p>
        Our research integrates cutting-edge approaches such as multi-agent reinforcement learning, 
        KalmanNet-based state estimation, real-time hardware-in-the-loop (HIL/PIL) validation, 
        and multiphysics modeling to develop high-performance and reliable energy management 
        solutions.
